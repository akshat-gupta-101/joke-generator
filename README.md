# ðŸŽ­ Joke Generator Flow  

## **Overview**  
The **Joke Generator** flow creates original jokes or short stand-up comedy scripts based on the topic and humor style you provide. Whether you're looking for quick laughs, witty one-liners, or a full comedy routine, this tool has you covered!  

## **How It Works**  
This flow takes two inputs:  
- **Topic** â€“ The subject of the joke (e.g., "Technology," "Relationships," "Office Life").  
- **Style** â€“ The type of humor you'd like (e.g., "Dark," "Observational," "Pun-based," "Dad jokes").  

It then uses a powerful AI model to generate a joke or a short stand-up routine in your chosen style.  

## **Examples**  

### **Example 1**  
**Input:**  
- Topic: **Technology**  
- Style: **Observational**  

**Output:**  
> "You ever notice how WiFi works perfectly fine until you really need it?  
> Like, you can stream 4K cat videos all day, but the moment youâ€™re on a Zoom call with your boss,  
> your internet decides to take a nap!"  

### **Example 2**  
**Input:**  
- Topic: **Parenting**  
- Style: **Dad Jokes**  

**Output:**  
> "Why did the dad bring a ladder to the bar?  
> Because he heard the drinks were on the house!" ðŸ˜‚
